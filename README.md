phychohistory: what it is and why it is
phychohistory is a science that by studying human history in detail, attempt to find patterns of mass human actions and to use these patterns to predict the actions of human masses. The science is only 
in the theroetical stage, so we need a bit of help. But, there's one crucial point about phychohistory: just HOW can you prove it's a valid science? Here, I shall represent my team (of three) to explain
a bit: 
Historians (here I mean people who have studied history in detail) who are expert in one of the more chaotic reigons of earth (post roman ~ WW2) all seem to be uneasy about the status quo, claiming that
there will be another world war. There is no team between them, nor is there any possibility in similarity in their mind patterns (their personality), so how, just HOW can they arrive to the same 
conclusion? They only have two things in common: 1. they're human 2. they have all studied history in detail of one of the more chaotic regions of earth. From these two factors we can gather that:
1. there is a pattern to human action
2. only humans can find that out
on these basises, we build our science
